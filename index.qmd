# About Me

I am a [KL2 scholar](https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa/about/training/programs) and hospitalist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. I am originally from Durham, North Carolina and went to medical school at UNC. I moved to Baltimore in 2016 for internal medicine residency at Johns Hopkins and joined the faculty after I graduated. I am currently an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hospital Medicine.

I am currently enrolled in the [Graduate Training Programs in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/academics/academic-program-finder/graduate-training-programs-in-clinical-investigation "Graduate Training Programs in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI)") at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health program. I am interested in utilizing data science to study observational data -- my recent work has been in COVID-19 and mpox.

On this website, you will find links to my research and contact information. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:will.garneau@gmail.com) if you would like to discuss potential projects.
