My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I moved to Baltimore, Maryland in 2016 for internal medicine residency at Johns Hopkins and joined the faculty after I graduated. I am an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hospital Medicine. My job includes caring for hospitalized patients, teaching medical students and residents, and performing clinical research.\nIn 2023 I received an NIH career development award. My prior research has used real-world data to answer emerging issues in COVID-19 and mpox such as the safety of Paxlovid in pregnancy and exploring risk factors for severe mpox. My current work is focused on improving care in the hospital for persons who use substances.\nI completed an MHS degree in the Graduate Training Programs in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2024.\nOn this website, you will find links to my research and contact information. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss potential projects.\ncode by DinosoftLabs from Noun Project (CC BY 3.0)"
