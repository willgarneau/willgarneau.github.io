My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth’s history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

I am originally from Durham, NC and went to medical school at UNC. I moved to Baltimore in 2016 for internal medicine residency at Johns Hopkins and joined the faculty after I graduated. I am currently an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hospital Medicine and over the past few years have been primarily a clinician educator. During the COVID19 pandemic I became more involved in research and this led me to apply for the KL2 program. I will be in the GTPCI program starting in August studying for an MHS in clinical investigation. I am interested in utilizing data science to study observational data – my recent work has been in COVID-19 and mpox.\nI am looking forward to developing my statistical and epidemiological knowledge and gaining more proficiency as a programmer over the next year in the Graduate Training Programs in Clinical Investigation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nOn this website, you will find links to my research and contact information. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss potential projects."
